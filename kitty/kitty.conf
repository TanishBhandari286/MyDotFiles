#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on "Stack Overflow"
#: to change it. The TERM variable is used by various programs to get
#: information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If
#: you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
#: different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
#: from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
#: work. Changing this option by reloading the config will only affect
#: newly created windows.

# The following command checks if tmux is installed.
# If tmux is installed, it automatically attaches to an existing tmux session.
# If no tmux session exists, a new one is created.
# If tmux is not installed, it simply starts zsh without tmux.
#
# For this to work properly, you need to make sure that your shell is configured
# for homebrew, so you should have this line:
# eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
# In your ~/.zprofile file
# If you don't have that line, or if the file doesn't exist, run this:
# echo '' >>~/.zprofile && echo '# Configure shell for brew' >>~/.zprofile && echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >>~/.zprofile && eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
#
# This assumes you installed tmux through brew if using macos
shell zsh --login -c "if command -v tmux >/dev/null 2>&1; then tmux attach || tmux; else zsh; fi"

# Old version of above command:
# The 2 commands after login are needed to automatically attach to an existing 
# tmux session, if no session exists, a new one is created
# shell zsh --login -c "tmux attach || tmux"

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the

#: Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab with at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it by window manager (e.g.
#: clicking the window close button or pressing the operating system
#: shortcut to close windows) or by the close_tab action. A value of
#: zero disables confirmation. This confirmation also applies to
#: requests to quit the entire application (all OS windows, via the
#: quit action). Negative values are converted to positive ones,
#: however, with shell_integration enabled, using negative values
#: means windows sitting at a shell prompt are not counted, only
#: windows where some command is currently running. Note that if you
#: want confirmation when closing individual windows, you can map the
#: close_window_with_confirmation action.
