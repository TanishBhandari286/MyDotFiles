# NOTE:
# This is not actually a script, just gave it .sh name for syntax highlighting

# NOTE:
# Make sure that you manually change your dirs here with '_' instead of
# '-' and '.' because these last 2 will be interpreted
# - Notice I also escaped the ';' with '\;'
# - Using "'" works, but not too well, because cannot switch to it from the
# tmux sessions pane (ctrl+b s)
