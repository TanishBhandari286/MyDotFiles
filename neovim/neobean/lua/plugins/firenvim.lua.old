Safari is not compatible, as it doesn't support Webextensions

This plugin file will install the plugin and run the built-in post-install script

After installing the plugin, I was getting the error "Unknown function: firenvim#install"

https://github.com/glacambre/firenvim/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#make-sure-the-firenvim-script-has-been-created
Run this command to make sure that the firenvim script was created:
  echo 'abcde{}' | ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-${HOME}/.local/share}/firenvim/firenvim
I was getting this error:
  zsh: no such file or directory: /Users/linkarzu/.local/share/firenvim/firenvim

By looking at :Lazy, the plugin was installed at ~/.local/share/neobean/lazy/firenvim
So I built firenvim using the instructions here:
  https://github.com/glacambre/firenvim/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-firenvim
The "npm run install_manifests" is the one that creates the firenvim script in ~/.local/share/firenvim

  cd ~/.local/share/neobean/lazy/firenvim
  npm install
  npm run build
  npm run install_manifests

After doing this, get the chrome extension

  lazy = not vim.g.started_by_firenvim,
  build = function()
    vim.fn["firenvim#install"](0)
  end,
}
